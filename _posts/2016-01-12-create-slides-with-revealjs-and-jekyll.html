### Slide Layout

reveal.js is already included as a `git submodule`, so that we can use it in our layouts.

Also a `slide.html` layout has been added into the `_layouts` folder which would be the base layout for all our slides.

### Creating Slide

Now, in your page/post YAML front matter, use `slide` for the layout.

You can define *title*, *author*, *description* as well as the slide's *theme* and
*transition*
